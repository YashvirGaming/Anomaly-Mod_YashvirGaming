Changelog: Version 1.4.4
Disabled remove lines, gonna rework it USE REMOVE NOISE as finding the correct threshold will remove them!
Fixed image being incorrectly rescaled when creating a nonindexed version for processing
Reworked Remove Noise to attempt to refill in the hole left behind from noise removal in characters
Quick fix to allow scraping from Proxyscrape, seems they've blacklisted the UA,
made it simply randomize a bit. In the future I will add the ability to let the user customize a UA in settings.
